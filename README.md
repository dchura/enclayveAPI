# enclayve device API
This is the home for app and web developers seeking to utilize an enclayve device.<BR>
There are currently two device configurations:
<BR>   - Crypto Wallet
<BR>   - Private Social Media
<BR>
<BR>For example, this is an enclayve wallet device:

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>An enclayve device is assumed to be the target of hackers, the target of theives, and the target of pranksters. It is even assumed that an attacker can have physical access to the device and can break it open. The overall architecture of the enclayve system uses many sophisticated cryptographic techniques to protect itself from network attacks, but also to protect the data stored on the device from physical attack.  An enclayve device does not depend upon SSL and has no public domain name. It is expected to reside in a home network, where only a scan of the Internet can find it.
<BR>
<BR>Note that there is a significant amount of cryptography background required to use this API.
<BR>Furthermore, the choice of algorithms, encodings, paddings, and structure is prescribed by the enclayve device.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> The basic architecture is below, for the Wallet product (the Social Media product has no blockchain interface yet)
